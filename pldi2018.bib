  abstract = {We present an interactive tool, called iscc, for manipulating sets and relations of integer tuples bounded by affine constraints over the set variables, parameters and existentially quantified variables. A distinguishing feature of iscc is that it provides a cardinality operation on sets and relations that computes a symbolic expression in terms of the parameters and domain variables for the number of elements in the set or the image of the relation. In particular, these expressions are piecewise quasipolynomials, which can be further manipulated in iscc. Besides basic operations on sets and piecewise quasipolynomials, iscc also provides an interface to code generation, lexicographic optimization, dependence analysis, transitive closures and the symbolic computation of upper bounds and sums of piecewise quasipolynomials over their domains.},

abstract="We are using bandit-based adaptive operator selection while autotuning parallel computer programs. The autotuning, which uses evolutionary algorithm-based stochastic sampling, takes place over an extended duration and occurs in situ as programs execute. The environment or context during tuning is either largely static in one scenario or dynamic in another. We rely upon adaptive operator selection to dynamically generate worthy test configurations of the program. In this paper, we study how the choice of hyperparameters, which control the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, affects the effectiveness of adaptive operator selection which in turn affects the performance of the autotuner. We show that while the optimal assignment of hyperparameters varies greatly between different benchmarks, there exists a single assignment, for a context, of hyperparameters that performs well regardless of the program being tuned.",

abstract = {Datacenter workloads demand high computational capabilities, flexibility, power efficiency, and low cost. It is challenging to improve all of these factors simultaneously. To advance datacenter capabilities beyond what commodity server designs can provide, we have designed and built a composable, reconfigurable fabric to accelerate portions of large-scale software services. Each instantiation of the fabric consists of a 6x8 2-D torus of high-end Stratix V FPGAs embedded into a half-rack of 48 machines. One FPGA is placed into each server, accessible through PCIe, and wired directly to other FPGAs with pairs of 10 Gb SAS cables. In this paper, we describe a medium-scale deployment of this fabric on a bed of 1,632 servers, and measure its efficacy in accelerating the Bing web search engine. We describe the requirements and architecture of the system, detail the critical engineering challenges and solutions needed to make the system robust in the presence of failures, and measure the performance, power, and resilience of the system when ranking candidate documents. Under high load, the large-scale reconfigurable fabric improves the ranking throughput of each server by a factor of 95% for a fixed latency distribution—or, while maintaining equivalent throughput, reduces the tail latency by 29%.},
